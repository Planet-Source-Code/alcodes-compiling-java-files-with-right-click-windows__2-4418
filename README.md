### Source Code

<br>This was done in windows by me because I became sick and tired of typing javac Foo.java, so if you too are tired of doing so and dont have something like forte, you can do the following:<br><br>
1. Go to ANY folder<br>
2. at the menu at the top of the page click: <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;view then click on file types<br><br>
3. search for java(manually), once you have found this, click on edit<br>IF YOU DONT FIND IT, click on new type, then type a description of the file (Java Source File for me), and the associated extension (java), you should also put in a mime type, but it isnt necessary<br><br>
4. Below Where it says actions, there should be a button saying "New", click on that button and add the following for action: Compile<br>
and for the application performed, look for javac.exe (C:\j2sdk141\bin\javac.exe for me) and ad a % sign after it<br><br>
Woo hoo, you done, now enjoy compiling java files the lazy way ;)
